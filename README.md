## Data Insights with Python
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Python libraries like OpenPyxl and Pandas to create and manipulate Excel files. It includes:

Data Creation: A sample dataset with employee details (name, domain, age, location, salary, experience) is created and saved to an Excel file.
Data Analysis: The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Visualization: Various visualizations using Seaborn to explore salary distributions and relationships between experience and salary.
